# This is a somewhat complicated test script. The goals are to test the
# following:
# 1) Can we share data for any data type?
# 2) Does each thread think it succeeded at setting the data?
# 3) Does the end result confirm that each thread changed the data?
# 4) Are we prevented from sharing slices?
#
# Here we allocate shared work space for each PDL data type. We then create
# a collection of threads and have each thread modify the contents of one
# part of the shared memory.
# 
# While there, each thread does a number of things. It sets a value in the
# shared memory, it confirms that the now-set value is correct, and it
# builds the hash of expected values from such checks. That last part need
# not be done in the threads explicitly, but it makes it easier to write. :-)
# 
# After all the threads return, we check that all the values agree with what
# we expect, which is fairly easy (though not entirely trivial) to construct
# by hand. I encorporate square-roots into the calculations to ensure good
# bit coverage of the tests, at least for the floating point numbers.
# 
# The last step simply confirms that sharing slices croaks, a pretty easy
# pair of tests.

# Allocate workspace with one extra slot (to verify zeroeth element troubles)
